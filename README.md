# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Link to live webpage: https://katychillingworth.github.io/Password-Generator/

## Overview

This week’s challenge requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Instructions

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
  
  ## Things I've done:
  
  * Made arrays of characters used 
  * Added prompts for password length and further prompts if data added wasn't within the acceptance criteria
  * Added Maths.random code to get a random number out of the array
  * Added a for loop to pull random characters to generate the password
  * Added event listeners
